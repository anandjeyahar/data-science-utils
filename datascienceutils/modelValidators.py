# Add tests of indpendence, when a model predicts multi-class labels and probabilities

# When a model predicts binary classification, add tests of similarity to binomial distribution(with
# random prior or a given prior)

# When a model is unsupervised clustering, do tests of independence on the clusters
# generated/predicted
