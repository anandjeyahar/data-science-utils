Contributing to datascienceutils

What is "open work"?

At http://gratipay.com/about, they have a definition:

“Open work” means that your company or organization makes it easy for any individual to do your work for you without asking you first, and as a result to share in any revenue you generate.
Do work first, ask permission later. Fun, isn't it? If you are opening a new issue or submitting a pull request, go for it! Don't be afraid that it's a dumb idea or a duplicate of another issue or an unwanted change or whatever. Maybe it is! We're still glad to have you! :^)

How you can contribute

Whether you are a programmer or not, you can contribute to datascienceutils.
Programmers:  See TODO.md for ideas/plans
Non-programmers: The big pending work for non-programmers is documentation. There's almost no documentation at the moment, just some example notebooks.
How?:
    Programmers:
	* - Fork the repo,
	* - do your changes
	* - Test them by changing(or  adding a cell to) the notebook
	* - Send a pull request.

    Non-programmers:
	* - Since everything else is markdown, it'd be great if you can stick to markdown.
 	* - Just add your module/function level docs to DOCS.md

Below are some ideas we've modified from this great blog post (more details at the link). You can check out a similar list here. If you see anything below that doesn't make sense, relax--find something you understand and start from there.
