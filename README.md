## data-science-utils

A set of functions for easing the work involved in data exploration stage before the Machine
Learning/Statistical Modeling stage.

For an example usage:
See: [MLDemo ](https://github.com/anandjeyahar/mlDemoExamples) or
	Or hosted on the nice nbviewer (Rackspace) people
	[here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anandjeyahar/mlDemoExamples/blob/master/IrisDataExplorer.ipynb)
All of the examples and demonstration have been moved to a separate repo [here.](https://github.com/anandjeyahar/mlDemoExamples)

P.S: Warning, the code base is a bit behind the current one so examples won't work exactly(though old ones should work with syntax/args tweaking, just a bunch of new functions won't.). Holding off on pushing the latest code, as I'm in the middle of switching jobs.
