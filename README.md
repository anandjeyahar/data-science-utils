## data-science-utils

A set of functions for easing the work involved in data exploration stage before the Machine
Learning/Statistical Modeling stage.

All of the examples and demonstration have been moved to a separate repo [here.](https://github.com/anandjeyahar/mlDemoExamples)

P.S: Warning, the code base is a bit behind the current one so examples won't work exactly(though old ones should work with syntax/args tweaking, just a bunch of new functions won't.). Holding off on pushing the latest code, as I'm in the middle of switching jobs.
