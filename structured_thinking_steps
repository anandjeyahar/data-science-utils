0. Figure out the questions involved in the analytics project and decide which ones can be tackled

1. Actually Look at the data summary(dataframe.describe()) that includes mean, mode, std, and quartiles)
2. Look for patterns in the summary. Think about what each of the values mean to your question? What

4. Figure out the ML problem use <a

5. Go back to step 1 and 2 again and redo them with the ML problem .
6. See if you have enough data (noise vs signal) or you need more samples or do you need more
features. (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html)
